# Simple Spring AOP Demonstration
I've tried to demonstrate following pointcuts:
1. execution 
2. @annotation


## Limitations
* join-points can be at method level not at field level in a class.
* Methods with public visibility will be advised.
* Local or internal method calls within an advised class donâ€™t get intercepted by proxy, 
  so the advice method of the aspect does not get fired or invoked.


## Getting Started
Please use Main class to run the program & trace accordingly.
